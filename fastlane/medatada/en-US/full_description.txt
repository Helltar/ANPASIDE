<p><i>ANPASIDE</i> is a mobile development environment using the MIDletPascal programming language compiler. Use J2ME Loader to run applications.</p>
<p>Note that the MidletPascal classes <a href='https://github.com/Helltar/ANPASIDE/issues/3#issuecomment-968088387' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>trigger false positives with several malware scanners</a>. This is because a back in the days of push-button phones on Java ME was written the RedBrowser Trojan program using MIDletPascal to sends SMS to paid numbers. The malware mentioned contains the MidletPascal classes, not vice versa.
